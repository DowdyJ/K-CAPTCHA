KB-CAPTCHA (Keyboard CAPTCHA) uses patterns in typical user typing behavior and machine learning to automatically determine if a user is a robot or not.
This repository contains all the tools used to build the model and sample frontend that uses the solution.

Instructions for installation and usage of the project are in "Docs/KB-CAPTCHA User Manual.pdf".
