        <h1>About KB-CAPTCHA</h1>
        <p>As bot detection technology has evolved, 
            so too have the abilities of bots and their makers to bypass these systems. While not all bots are harmful, 
            it is important that service providers and webhosts can choose when and how to restrict bot traffic. 
            To combat bots, website owners frequently turn to CAPTCHA as a solution. Often times, this is a varation of the image CAPTCHA. 
            Users are to look at confusing pictures and try to distinguish between images. However, this introduces several problems. 
            First, these image CAPTCHAs are unpleasant to solve. 
            Second, services have appeared which offer to solve CAPTCHAs both with AI and real humans who will solve the problems for a fee. 
            As a result, real users are forced to solve these troublesome puzzles while bots do their actions unfettered by these precautions. The KB-CAPTCHA project hopes to offer an alternative to this. 
            By analyzing users' actions while using a service, keyboard input in particular, we can make a guess as to whether a user is a bot or not.</p>
